## Abstract

Among academic work, it seems there is no doubt about the possibility of spatially concentrated patterns of economic activity to generate some gains in the firms performs involved. These activity agglomerations have been called in a variety of different ways, depending on complexity of the analyzed phenomena: industrial districts, industrial complex, regional productive systems, regional innovation systems or clusters, among others. It is common that policy makers opt to take some policy based on the notion of agglomeration advantages to promote regional growth and development. Nevertheless, a not clear distinction of the meaning of these terms and some times their interchangeability usage cause ambiguity, and then obstacles for their empirical identification. Besides, certainly linked to the previous reason, there are not a clear consensus on methodologies to identify such a spatially concentrated patterns of economic activity. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, it seeks to contribute to clarify the meaning of the different concepts used to describe spatially concentrated patterns of economic activity through a critical compare. Second, based on the previous distinction, it makes a survey on the existing methods for identification  in international literature and specifically in Mexico in the last ten years.


## Introduction

The not homogeneously distributed economic activity allover the space is a well known fact, it is concentrated at some places rather [@WorldBank2009]. Names received for those **economic activity concentration patterns** (EACP) differ depending on the complexity and linkages with other social phenomenons. In specialized literature, arise concepts as industrial complexes, industrial clusters, regional productive agglomerations, regional innovative systems, milleaux innovative, and others. Some are used to describe the economic linkages between firms on a region though the input-output relations. Others try to capture the institutional determinants behind the growth regional process, and some more remark the conditioning to the innovations.

Gordon and MacCann [-@GordonAndMacCann2000] remark the ambiguity on the cluster term and point out the emerging obstacles to their empirical testing. This concept had received sever criticism from Martin and Sunley [-@MartinSunley2003] in a theoretical and empirical way. The term "localized industries" (coined by Marshall to describe economic related activities concentrated in specific places) is used sometimes without consider the historical context in which it emerged: it was devised to describe the spatial concentration of small and medium firms (SMEs) "limited by distances that could be economically traversed daily by workers and suppliers in the late nineteenth century" [@TripplBergman2014: 450]. Some terms, like neo-marshallian industrial district, include sometimes vague ideas in an attempt to include non economic facto rs, like culture and institutions ("entrepreneur or industrial atmosphere") and the milleaux innovative concept often is not enough clear to distinguish it to the network concept. All of this causes difficult to understand and measure the EACP.  

There have been attempts to make the concepts related to EACP more clear. Trippl and Bergman [-@TripplBergman2014] distinguish among industrial districts, innovative milieus, and industrial clusters. They point out similarities and differences based on spatial dimension, main participants and their motivations and interactions. Gordon and MacCann [-@GordonAndMacCann2000] describe the differences in three clear theories to EACP: the model of pure agglomeration in the Marshall point of view, the industrial-complex model and the social-network model. They remake their differences according to the existent evidence that soport the theorical models and their policy implications.  

These conceptual diversity is associated to even more vast quantity of methodological approaches to identify EACP. That is, there is no a unique term or concept to describe the EACP, but even within the same term, the methodological diversity is present [@Komorowski2020].  

Cruz and Teixeira [-@CruzTeixeira2010] survey the evolution of the cluster literature thought bibliometric techniques in the 1962-2008 period. They identify and group  those studies concerning to methods and measures "that have been developed to provide more objective ways to identify, classify, and explain clustering processes" (p. 1272). These kind of studies were fecund in seventies, especially those that concern on conceptualization of analytical methods. Because the main problem with EACP from a technical point of view is the _pattern identifications_, studding the methods to identify clusters is very close to computational techniques such as clustering and groping methods [@Adolfsson-etal2018]. 

Multiples studies in regional economics use methods based on the identification of input-output linkages on a national economy [@FeserBergman2000; @Feser-etal2005; @Sonis2008; @Delgado-etal2016; @GonzalezVillareal2017; @LagunaReyes2010; @TrejoNegrete2018]. Others perform their analysis using measures of agglomeration or specialization [@Kopczewska-etal2017; @Komorowski2020; @Gleave-etal2004; @GarciaCastro2008], case study on management persective [@Piccinetti2015]. The most recent methodological approaches try to fix some weakness of the classical methods using better algorithms [@AlmasriAndShukur2008], introducing techniques to deal with microlevel data [@BonneuThomas2015] or introducing network analysis [@Sheresheva-etal2022].  

Despite the topic of methods of identification of EACP is a prolific field in the regional science, it is not usual for this kind of empirical studies critically evaluate the concept their are attempting to measure in the social reality and just a few do it. For example, Villarreal, Mack, and Flores [-@GonzalezVillareal2017] distinguish the concept of industrial complex from industrial district. For them, industrial district consider non-economic aspects, such as institutional and socio-cultural aspects, but those are not relevant for the industrial complex concept. Meanwhile, the industrial complex differs from the cluster in that the industrial complex offers greater precision in the geographical scope, which is usually vague in the definition of cluster. On the studies on clusters to Mexico, there is some methods that uses a macroeconomic interrelation structure based on the input-output matrix and then the found structure is used to investigate it in a regional context (@LagunaReyes2010). Others start from a regional context identifying the relevant activities and give less attention to the links with the economic general structure (@TrejoNieto2013). 

The policy purposes of the studies on concentration economic activity identification are also relevant (**some studies here**). The academic consensus related to the agglomeration economies on the potential benefits of the agglomerated activities over firms, region and whole economy, makes identification of such agglomerations the first step to reinforce them [@Komorowski2020]. So that, it is possible to identify a necessity to discus the strength and weakness of the available identification methods not only for academic and scientific purpouses, but because their potential use to policy makers. 

The objective of this paper is twofold. First, it seeks to contribute to clarify the meaning of the different concepts used to describe spatially concentrated patterns of economic activity through a critical compare. Second, based on the previous distinction, it makes a survey on the existing methods for identification  in international literature and specifically in Mexico in the last ten years. The remmaing of this document has the following structure. In the next section, a critical distinction on the idea of  **economic activity concentration patterns** is given. Then, based on the previous section, each class of classification method is presented pointing theirs strengths, weaknesses and some applications in international studies and in the Mexican context. Finally, a short reflection on the found methods and their policy implications for Mexican regional industrial policy is presented.


## **Economic activity concentration patterns** and agglomeration forces: a short conceptual distintion.


Objective: list different concepts to rely on the fact of **economic activity concentration patterns** (or **spatially concentrated industries**). Try to distinguish between them according to the studied phenomenon.

i) Spatial concentration and forces linked to.
ii) Concepts and their meanings and the literature where we found a better explain to them

* Industrial district-Marshall and then Neo-Marshallian industrial districts on Itally-Becattin
* Growth poles-Perroux
* Innovative milieus-GREMI
* Industrial cluster-Porter.

* A key element to understand and distinguish among the multiple existent concepts related to concentration patterns on economic activity is the capitalist development period in which terms were coined. For example, industrial district term was proposed by Marshall in the begging of the Twenty Century to reflect a kind of society that was in extinction: little  manufacturers focused to serve local markets. On the other hand, the neo-marshalian term it is about semi or even not capitalist production were the craftsman authority and the place tratition is relevant.

* Another element to distinguish existent terms are the extension of the reality that they are trying to capture: only economic relations, versus socio institutional factors and the importance given to each one in the explanation.  

* Distinguish between the type of economic unit, family owned, little enterprise leaded by the first or second capitalist generation or corporative firm structure is a key concept to understand economic processes like innovation and "knowledge dissemination". How a little firm make innovation compared with a multinational?  

* Identification of spatial patterns of economic activities must take in count the kind of agglomeration to want to be detected, that is, is it structured by SMEs or MNA firms? This is relevant because the extent, operation and related factors like innovation process and even factors enhancing capital accumulation process may differ among types of participants. Where the interest are in the SMEs and the MNA? In local development problems or profitability?  

* The attention given to the socioinstitucional and cultural variables by the Neo-Marshallians and their enphasis on the SMEs firms resembles, in some way, to the competitive phase of capitalism.

A central theme in Regional Science has been the forces shaping space that made the economic activity agglomerates [@Fischer2014]. The driving forces shaping spatial patterns of economic activity are linked to agglomeration economies which  have their origin in physical proximity between firms and urban structure [@GordonAndMacCannn2000: 516]. Those forces influence the firms performance and they benefit with cost reductions (Cohen and Morrison, 2009). Usually, the agglomeration economies are divided in two types: i) agglomeration economies of specialization or Marshall-Arrow-Romer (MAR) and they refer agglomeration of firms of the same industry (**Glaeser, 1992; SjÃ¶holm, 1999: 560; @TripplBergman2014**), and ii) urbanization economies or Jacobs economies where is not the specialization, but the diversity and variety of geographical economic concentrated activities that promote innovation and growth [@Duranton2014, @VanOortAndLambooy2014]. 

These activity agglomerations have been called in very different ways [@Bathelt-Li2014] and but not always clear enough to empirical testing, particularly in policy context [@GordonAndMacCannn2000]. As is well known, Marshall (**1920**) describes the causes and consequences of activity agglomerations in what he called industrial districts. He linked spatial agglomeration to three forces: i) knowledge spillovers, ii) rise of supplier industries and iii) labor market effects [@TripplBergman2014]. The agglomerated small and medium (SMEs) enterprises take advantages from the rise of agglomeration economies and they are able to compete with large firms. A very close term used in the economic urban literature is _industrial complex_, they are "characterised  by  sets  of identifiable and stable relations among firms which are in part manifested in their spatial behaviour. The relations are conceived primarily in terms of trading links, and it is these patterns of sales and purchases which are seen as principally governing their locational behaviour" [@GordonAndMacCannn2000: 518]

During the capitalism golden age, there was various attempts to theorize about the regional development process on the lagged economies in a regional context. Among them, Perroux's contribution, the well known growth poles theory, was "characterized by the use of huge financial and fiscal incentives to external large firms and the idea of imitation and reproduction of the development conditions and organizations already experienced in developed region" [@Garofoli2020encyclopedia: 199]. __One more word about the spatial aspects of the growth poles__

In the 70s, in the meddle of a generalized global fordism model crisis, some SMEs firms in Italy find the way to survive taking advantages not only from physical proximity, but many social and cultural situations. The studies by Becattini (1979) and their contributors on causes of success of the Third Italy bring the concept of Neo-Marshallian Industrial Districts where the economic variables were important but far from beeing the only determinant of development success. Becattini describe the Neo-Marshallian Industrial Discrict as "complex socioeconomic settings and highlighted the relation between efficiency and competitiveness of production and the sociocultural conditions prevailing at the regional level" [@TripplBergman2014: 444]. 

By the declining of some industrial poles in France in the late 1970s, another concept arose used to describe a capable regions to generate and promote growth based on innovations: Milieux Innovateurs, a concept particularly extended on French researches, and sometimes used interchangeably by **network** concept [@Gallaud2013encyclopedia]. Trippl & Bergman (2021: 444) define a milieu "as a set of region-specific rules, practices,and institutions that enhances the capacity of regional actors to innovate and to coordinate with other innovative actors". Once again,  the concepts goes beyond the pure economic aspects of the agglomerated activities and remark the role of innovation. An attempt to extend the concerned phenomenon on the innovation process from a territorial point of view, some are proposed the concept of _territorial production system_ (Crevoisier and Maillat, 1991; cited by @TripplBergman2014: 446), which is less clear in their scope.

Maybe the most popular concept related to what it is called here **Economic activity concentration patterns** is the cluster term. The popularity and international dissemination of the cluster concept is due to the PorterÂ´s work on _corporate_ strategies, and the, it is use tipically to refer to those kind of firms. Weighing more the competitive rather the cooperative aspects of a cluster, Porter defines them as  "geographic concentrations of interconnected _companies_, specialized suppliers, service providers, firms in related industries, and associated institutions in particular fields that compete but also cooperateâ [Porter 1998, p. 197, cited by @TripplBergman2014: 447]. Nevertheless, the concepts has received many criticism because its ambiguity [@MartinSunley2003, @Pacheco2007] and the lack of precision on geographical and sectorial limits, and he do not make emphasis on the social factors linked to clusters [@TripplBergman2014].


The theoretical gape identified by [@TripplBergman2014] in relation to spatially concentrated industries are the necesity to undestand their evolution and trajectories over time.














 


are often called, among others: industrial districts (**Marhsal, 19XX**), some times growth poles (Perroux)clusters (**cite: Porter 1985**), regional or local productive systems, regional innovation systems (**cite: Delphine Gallaud 2013**), depending on complexity of the analyzed phenomena. In the past, manufacture agglomerations had received especial attention under heterodox regional development theories framework [@Hirschman1958, @Perroux1955]. Those theories grant to industry a central role in economic structure and a solid capability to stimulate growth and to push whole economy through intersectorial linkages.







## Regional industrial clusters: methodological approaches

Some introductions words

@Komorowski2020 describe and compare three different traditional methods to identify industrial clusters: relative indexes on employment, normalized and transformed location quotients on employment and dot maps to see visual patterns. He illustrate this method using data from media industry from Brussels and find that all of them show limitations in: identifying the extent and location of the studied cluster, availability of the data used and some distortions due to the presence of large enterprises and the scale of the spatial unit and  (p. 98).


Top-down

In words of @LagunaReyes2010, this approach "allows the identification of production chains at the regional level, based on national grouping patterns. This makes it possible to identify the gaps between local supply chains compared to national ones, which makes it possible to determine areas of specialization, regional competitive advantages and regional development opportunities" (p. 127).

@TrejoNegrete2018 say that the Feser and Bergman Method "meets five criteria that make it a useful tool to identify groupings, when input-output information is available, which are: a) reliability; b) ability to generate results in the short term; c) low instrumentation cost; d) possibility of sectorial disaggregation of the information and e) flexibility to visualize the presence of clusters in different geographical areas.


On the other hand, this approach has some weakness "since by using the national economy as a reference, it implicitly assumes that the differences in technology, labor productivity and consumption patterns between the national economy and local economies are null, which can be misleading, especially in cases in which the region truly specializes in a particular production chain" (p. 127). 

### Top down aproache

#### Studies to Mexico

@MendozaVelazquez2017 appeals to the Porter's approach based on US Clusters Mapping by Institute for Strategy
and Competitiveness from Harvard Business School. Mendoza Velasquez identify 41 clusters of traded industries, it is, activities whose localization rarely depend on geographical conditions and natural endowments. From these, "eight out of which are classified as high-technology clusters, 10 as service clusters and 23 as other manufacturing industries clusters. Each cluster contains on average 28 industries" [@MendozaVelazquez2017: 415]

@GonzalezVillareal2017 seek to identify for Mexico what they call industrial complexes with the objective to propose some economic policy ideas in the frame of smart specialization and related variety. The used method is divided in two stages: first, the identify the relevant industrial productive chains through the Feser and Bergman [-@FeserBergman2000] method; secondly, the identified relevant productive chains are then spatialized by means of location quotients from employment for local economies. The authors find out five value chains concentrated in several regional complexes: electronics component  manufacturing (12 complexes),  automobiles (18 complexes),  chemicals (39 complexes), textiles and apparel (38 complexes), and agricultural and processed food (43 complexes).

In the same fashion, the work of @LagunaReyes2010 tries to find industrial clusters in the Mexican regions thought the Feser and Bergman (2000) technique and an extension  based on Rey and Mattheis (2000). He uses a Input-Ouput Matrix for Mexican economy to 76 activities in 1996. He idenfied 12 productive chains: Metalworking and automotive, Non-metallic minerals and other metallic products, Chemicals, Food products, Energy and derivatives, Textiles, Electronics and its parts, Paper and cardboard products, Inputs for the production of auto parts, Non-ferrous metals and their products, Leather products and Animal food. Nevertheless, he doesn't address the regions where the clusters are.

Using the FBA, @NietoNegrete2018 identify six clusters in the central region of Mexico (Mexico City, Mexico State, Hidalgo, QuerÃ©taro, Puebla, Tlaxcala, Morelos) grouping 21 of the 28 sectors of the regional IOM they used in their study: Consumer services, Superior services, Construction and housing, Agribusiness, Chemicals and Miscellaneous manufacturing.
