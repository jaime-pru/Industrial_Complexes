# Industrial complexes

Research project on identification of industrial complexes in Mexico based on Feser and Bergman (2000) and Feser et al. (2005).

Here are offered the instructions for the development of the methods used in [the report](https://github.com/jaime-pru/Industrial_Complexes/blob/main/T%C3%A9cnicas%20de%20an%C3%A1lisis%20regional%20para%20detectar%20cl%C3%BAsteres%20industriales-2023-02-24.Rmd) (principal component analysis and delimitation of industrial complexes with the local spatial association Moran index), all files are in .Rmd format, which combines text and code segments from R software.

In addition, it has 3 folders:  

i) databases, which contains the files with the information used, the spatial database is integrated by files in .shp format, the MIP and municipal employment information are in Excel spreadsheets,  
ii) code: contains files in .R format with the custom functions used in the project, and  
iii) bibliography which has the theoretical-methodological documents that served as the basis for this work.
